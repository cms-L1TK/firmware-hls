# firmware-hls : HLS implementation of the hybrid L1 track firmware

## Repo directory contents:

- IntegrationTests/ : HDL top files and simulations for chains of HLS modules and memories.
- TestBenches/ : Test bench code.
- TrackletAlgorithm/ : Algo source code.
- TrackQuality/ : BDT Track Quality specific source code.
- emData/ : .dat files with input/output test-bench data (corresponding to memory between algo steps) + .tab files of data for LUTs used internally by algos.
- project/ : .tcl scripts to create HLS project, compile & run code.

> Most of the following directions will reference Vivado HLS and the corresponding `vivado_hls` command. You may use Vitis HLS instead by replacing all of the `vivado_hls` commands with `vitis_hls`.

An HLS project can be generated by running tcl file with Vivado/Vitis HLS in firmware-hls/project/ directory. e.g. To do so for the ProjectionRouter:

        vivado_hls -f script_PR.tcl

This would create a project directory \<project> ("projrouter" in case of the above example). The project name is defined in the tcl script. To open the project in GUI:

        vivado_hls -p <project>

## Running chains (illustrated for IR to TB skinny chain)

1) `cd IntegrationTests/ReducedConfig/IRtoTB/script/`
2) `make -j $(nproc) Work` (makes HLS IP cores; run as many jobs as you have CPU cores).
3) `vivado -mode batch -source runSim.tcl` (runs Vivado simulation,
   which writes data output from chain to dataOut/*.txt).
4) `python ../../../common/script/CompareMemPrintsFW.py -p -s` (compares .txt files in emData and dataOut/ writing comparison to dataOut/*_cmp.txt. Uses Python 3.).
5) `make Work/Work.runs/synth_1` (runs synthesis, writes utilization & timing reports to current directory).
6) `make Work/Work.runs/impl_1` (runs implementation, writes utilization & timing reports to current directory). N.B. This step is optional, and not required for code validation.

## Format of emData/ files.

### .dat files (test bench input/output data)

These have test data corresponding to the contents of the memories between algo steps. Their data format is explained 
in https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HybridDataFormat . 

e.g. AllStubs*.dat contains one row per stub: "stub_number stub_coords_(binary)[r|z|phi|...] ditto_but_in_hex"; StubPairs*.dat contains one row per stub pair "pair_number stub_index_in_allstubs_mem_(binary)[innerLayer|outerLayer] ditto_but_in_hex.

File naming convention: "L3" or "D5" indicate barrel or disk number; "PHIC" indicates 3rd course phi division given layer of nonant.

Some of the files are large, so not stored directly in git. These are automatically downloaded when any of the scripts in the project/ directory are executed within Vivado/Vitis HLS.

### .tab and .dat files 

These correspond to LUT used internally by the algo steps. The .tab file are in C++ and can be #include and compiled. The .dat files are a list of hex numbers which are easier to read in in hdl.

## Corresponding CMSSW L1 track emulation

### Full configuration

The files that are downloaded by emData/download.sh were created by the CMSSSW L1 track emulation, with the the following recipe (adapted from the [L1TrackSoftware TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/L1TrackSoftware)).

```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4
cd CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4/src/
cmsenv
git cms-checkout-topic -u cms-L1TK:fw_synch_220523
```

A few configuration changes were made in order to output test vectors and lookup tables and adjust truncation. This required editing parameter values in L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/Settings.h to match the following excerpts:

```c++
…
    //IR should be set to 108 to match the FW for the summer chain, but ultimately should be at 156
    std::unordered_map<std::string, unsigned int> maxstep_{{"IR", 108},  //IR will run at a higher clock speed to handle
                                                                         //input links running at 25 Gbits/s
                                                           //Set to 108 to match firmware project 240 MHz clock
…
    //--- These used to create files needed by HLS code.
    bool writeMem_{true};     //If true will print out content of memories (between algo steps) to files
    bool writeTable_{true};   //If true will print out content of LUTs to files
    bool writeConfig_{true};  //If true will print out the autogenerated configuration as files
…
    bool writeHLSInvTable_{true};  //Write out tables of drinv and invt in tracklet calculator for HLS module
…
```

Then compilation was done with the usual command:

```bash
scram b -j8
```

The maximum number of events in L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/test/L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py was set to 100:

```python
…
process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet(input = cms.untracked.int32(100))
…
```

Also, in the same file, the algorithm was set to HYBRID_NEWKF:

```python
…
# Set L1 tracking algorithm:
# 'HYBRID' (baseline, 4par fit) or 'HYBRID_DISPLACED' (extended, 5par fit).
# 'HYBRID_NEWKF' (baseline, 4par fit, with bit-accurate KF emulation),
# 'HYBRID_REDUCED' to use the "Summer Chain" configuration with reduced inputs.
# (Or legacy algos 'TMTT' or 'TRACKLET').
L1TRKALGO = 'HYBRID_NEWKF'
…
```

Finally, the emulation was run with:

```bash
cd L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/test/
cmsRun L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py
```

### Reduced configuration

The files for the reduced configuration used for the summer/skinny chain were
created by first running the full configuration as described above. Then, the
[project_generation_scripts](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/project_generation_scripts)
repo was cloned, the wiring files for the full configuration were copied, the
makeReducedConfig.py script was run, and the wiring files for the reduced
configuration were copied back into the release:

```bash
cd $CMSSW_BASE/../
git clone https://github.com/cms-L1TK/project_generation_scripts.git
cd project_generation_scripts/
cp $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/LUTs/*.dat ./
./makeReducedConfig.py --no-graph
cp -fv reduced_*.dat $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/
cd -
```

The algorithm was changed to HYBRID_REDUCED:

```python
…
# Set L1 tracking algorithm:
# 'HYBRID' (baseline, 4par fit) or 'HYBRID_DISPLACED' (extended, 5par fit).
# 'HYBRID_NEWKF' (baseline, 4par fit, with bit-accurate KF emulation),
# 'HYBRID_REDUCED' to use the "Summer Chain" configuration with reduced inputs.
# (Or legacy algos 'TMTT' or 'TRACKLET').
L1TRKALGO = 'HYBRID_REDUCED'
…
```

Finally, the emulation was rerun as for the full configuration:

```bash
cmsRun L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py
```

### Configuration with combined modules

The files for the configuration with combined modules (i.e., the
TrackletProcessor and MatchProcessor) were created with the same recipe as for
the full configuration described above, except the `combined_` parameter was
also set to true in L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/Settings.h:

```c++
…
    bool combined_{true};  // use combined TP (TE+TC) and MP (PR+ME+MC) configuration
…
```

Compilation was done again with the usual command:

```bash
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
scram b -j8
cd -
```

The algorithm was reset to HYBRID_NEWKF:

```python
…
# Set L1 tracking algorithm:
# 'HYBRID' (baseline, 4par fit) or 'HYBRID_DISPLACED' (extended, 5par fit).
# 'HYBRID_NEWKF' (baseline, 4par fit, with bit-accurate KF emulation),
# 'HYBRID_REDUCED' to use the "Summer Chain" configuration with reduced inputs.
# (Or legacy algos 'TMTT' or 'TRACKLET').
L1TRKALGO = 'HYBRID_NEWKF'
…
```

Finally, the emulation was rerun as before:

```bash
cmsRun L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py
```

### Barrel-only configuration (very preliminary)

The files for the barrel-only configuration were created by first running the
full configuration as described above. Then, the head of the barrel_config
branch of the emulation was checked out and compiled:

```bash
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/
git ls-files -m | xargs git checkout --
git cms-checkout-topic -u cms-L1TK:e5047997b33dc6cfb1d7ce35aa34dfc56c0fe9bf
scram b -j8
cd -
```

The
[project_generation_scripts](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/project_generation_scripts)
repo was cloned, the wiring files for the full configuration were copied, the
makeBarrelConfig.py script was run, and the wiring files for the barrel-only
configuration were copied back into the release:

```bash
cd $CMSSW_BASE/../
git clone https://github.com/cms-L1TK/project_generation_scripts.git
cd project_generation_scripts/
cp $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/LUTs/*.dat ./
./makeBarrelConfig.py
cp -fv barrel_*.dat $CMSSW_BASE/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/
cd -
```

The algorithm was reset to HYBRID_NEWKF:

```python
…
# Set L1 tracking algorithm:
# 'HYBRID' (baseline, 4par fit) or 'HYBRID_DISPLACED' (extended, 5par fit).
# 'HYBRID_NEWKF' (baseline, 4par fit, with bit-accurate KF emulation),
# 'HYBRID_REDUCED' to use the "Summer Chain" configuration with reduced inputs.
# (Or legacy algos 'TMTT' or 'TRACKLET').
L1TRKALGO = 'HYBRID_NEWKF'
…
```

Finally, the emulation was rerun as before:

```bash
cmsRun L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py
```

## Generation of LUTs and MemPrint files for the reduced combined module chain

The steps needed to generate the configurations files for the reduced combined module chain is explained below.

Step 1: Produce the reduced configuration

Modify the makeReducedConfig.py script online 188 

-        print("Starting with node TC_%s%s"%(layers,tcs[tc_i]))
-        n = node("TC_%s%s"%(layers,tcs[tc_i]))
+        print("Starting with node TP_%s%s"%(layers,tcs[tc_i]))
+        n = node("TP_%s%s"%(layers,tcs[tc_i]))

Copy over the wires.dat, memorymodules.dat, and processingmodules.dat from the full configuration for the reduced modules to the area where you are runing the makeReducedConfig.py

After doing this run the script with the options:

./makeReducedConfig.py --no-graph --sector C

This should produce the three files

 - reduced_wires.dat
 - reduced_memorymodules.dat
 - reduced_processingmodules.dat 

Step 2: Run CMSSW to pruduce the test vectors

NOTE - This has been tested in CMSSW_12_5_0_pre2 with the code in the PR #182 (Branch: ReducedCombinedModuleFixes) This PR was submitted on Aug. 7, 2022.

Copy the three reduced_*.dat files produced in Step 1 above to the 'data' director where you run CMSSW (TrackletTrackFinding/data)


Modify interface/Settings.h

Make IR process 108 stubs:

-    std::unordered_map<std::string, unsigned int> maxstep_{{"IR", 156},  //IR will run at a higher clock speed to handle
+    std::unordered_map<std::string, unsigned int> maxstep_{{"IR", 108},  //IR will run at a higher clock speed to handle

Print out memory and LUT files. (The writeConfig does not actually write out the config as it is not autogenerate, but read from a file.)

-    bool writeMem_{false};     //If true will print out content of memories (between algo steps) to files
-    bool writeTable_{false};   //If true will print out content of LUTs to files
-    bool writeConfig_{false};  //If true will print out the autogenerated configuration as files
+    bool writeMem_{true};     //If true will print out content of memories (between algo steps) to files
+    bool writeTable_{true};   //If true will print out content of LUTs to files
+    bool writeConfig_{true};  //If true will print out the autogenerated configuration as files

Turn off multiple matches in the MP

-    bool doMultipleMatches_{true};
+    bool doMultipleMatches_{false};

Use combined modules

-    bool combined_{false};
+    bool combined_{true};


Modify python/Tracklet_cfi.py

-    Reduced = cms.bool(False),
+    Reduced = cms.bool(True),

and

-    memoryModulesFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/memorymodules_hourglassExtended.dat'),
-    processingModulesFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/processingmodules_hourglassExtended.dat'),
-    wiresFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/wires_hourglassExtended.dat'),
+    memoryModulesFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/reduced_memorymodules.dat'),
+    processingModulesFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/reduced_processingmodules.dat'),
+    wiresFile = cms.FileInPath('L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/data/reduced_wires.dat'),


Modify test/L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py:

We will start on event 60 and process 40 events as there is a few events in this file that has tracks in the region we are using for the CM chain between event 60 and 70:

-process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet(input = cms.untracked.int32(10))
+process.maxEvents = cms.untracked.PSet(input = cms.untracked.int32(40))
 
 
-process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource", fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(*inputMC))
+#process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource", fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(*inputMC))

-#process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource", fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(*inputMC), skipEvents = cms.untracked.uint32(11))
+process.source = cms.Source("PoolSource", fileNames = cms.untracked.vstring(*inputMC), skipEvents = cms.untracked.uint32(60))

After runing (cmsRun L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfg.py) in the TrackFindingTracklet/test director copy the configuration files:

 cp reduced_wires.dat LUTs/wires.dat
 cp reduced_memorymodules.dat LUTs/memorymodules.dat
 cp reduced_processingmodules.dat LUTs/processingmodules.dat

Then create the tar balls:

tar czf MemPrints_CombinedReduced_220807.tgz MemPrints
tar czf LUTs_CombinedReduced_220807.tgz LUTs

                                                           





## Continuous Integration (CI) 

Purpose: Automatically run SW quality checks and build the HLS projects (csim, csynth, cosim, and export) for a PR to the master.

In order to keep the GitHub repository public we use GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD:

* GitHub Actions uses a public runner, the workflow is defined in .github/workflows/github_CI.yml
* GitHub Actions mirrors the repository to GitLab and runs GitLab CI/CD
* GitLab CI/CD uses a private runner (lnxfarm327.colorado.edu) and performs the SW quality checks and the HLS builds as defined in .gitlab-ci.yml
    - SW quality checks are based on clang-tidy (llvm-toolset-7.0) and are defined in .clang-tidy and .clang-format very similar to CMSSW
    - HLS builds are using Vivado HLS (or Vitis HLS) and are defined in the script files of the project folder
    - Results (logs and artifacts) of the SW quality checks and HLS builds can be found here https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/firmware-hls/pipelines
    - The default behavior blocks a stage (e.g. Hls-build) when a previous stage (e.g. Quality-check) failed 
* GitHub Actions pulls the GitLab CI/CD status and the pass/fail outcome

### Use CI for Personal Branch

* Add your branch name to the "on:" section of .github/workflows/GitLab_CI.yml 
    - In the "push:" subsection to trigger CI on each push, e.g. "branches: [feat_CI,<your_branch_name>]" and/or
    - in the "pull_request:" subsection to trigger CI on each PR, e.g. "branches: [master,<your_branch_name>]"
