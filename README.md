# firmware-hls : HLS implementation of the hybrid L1 track firmware 

## Repo directory contents:

- IntegrationTests/ : HDL top files and simulations for chains of HLS modules and memories.
- TestBenches/ : Test bench code.
- TrackletAlgorithm/ : Algo source code.
- TrackQuality/ : BDT Track Quality specific source code.
- emData/ : .dat files with input/output test-bench data (corresponding to memory between algo steps) + .tab files of data for LUTs used internally by algos.
- project/ : .tcl scripts to create HLS project, compile & run code.

> Most of the following directions will reference Vivado HLS and the corresponding `vivado_hls` command. You may use Vitis HLS instead by replacing all of the `vivado_hls` commands with `vitis_hls`.

An HLS project can be generated by running tcl file with Vivado/Vitis HLS in firmware-hls/project/ directory. e.g. To do so for the ProjectionRouter:

        vivado_hls -f script_PR.tcl

This would create a project directory \<project> ("projrouter" in case of the above example). The project name is defined in the tcl script. To open the project in GUI:

        vivado_hls -p <project>

## Running chains (illustrated for IR to TB skinny chain)

1) `cd IntegrationTests/ReducedConfig/IRtoTB/script/`
2) `make -j $(nproc) Work` (makes HLS IP cores; run as many jobs as you have CPU cores).
3) `vivado -mode batch -source runSim.tcl` (runs Vivado simulation,
   which writes data output from chain to dataOut/*.txt).
4) `python ../../../common/script/CompareMemPrintsFW.py -p -s` (compares .txt files in emData and dataOut/ writing comparison to dataOut/*_cmp.txt. Uses Python 3.).
5) `make Work/Work.runs/synth_1` (runs synthesis, writes utilization & timing reports to current directory).
6) `make Work/Work.runs/impl_1` (runs implementation, writes utilization & timing reports to current directory). N.B. This step is optional, and not required for code validation.

## Format of emData/ files.

### .dat files (test bench input/output data)

These have test data corresponding to the contents of the memories between algo steps. Their data format is explained 
in https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HybridDataFormat . 

e.g. AllStubs*.dat contains one row per stub: "stub_number stub_coords_(binary)[r|z|phi|...] ditto_but_in_hex"; StubPairs*.dat contains one row per stub pair "pair_number stub_index_in_allstubs_mem_(binary)[innerLayer|outerLayer] ditto_but_in_hex.

File naming convention: "L3" or "D5" indicate barrel or disk number; "PHIC" indicates 3rd course phi division given layer of nonant.

Some of the files are large, so not stored directly in git. These are automatically downloaded when any of the scripts in the project/ directory are executed within Vivado/Vitis HLS.

### .tab and .dat files 

These correspond to LUT used internally by the algo steps. The .tab file are in C++ and can be #include and compiled. The .dat files are a list of hex numbers which are easier to read in in hdl.

## Corresponding CMSSW L1 track emulation

### Full configuration with combined modules

The files that are downloaded by emData/download.sh were created by the CMSSSW L1 track emulation, with the the following recipe (adapted from the [L1TrackSoftware TWiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/L1TrackSoftware)).

```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_13_3_0_pre2
cd CMSSW_13_3_0_pre2/src/
cmsenv
git cms-checkout-topic -u cms-L1TK:a2c799d8c30310fef875a722645c0b8bd120061e
```

A few configuration changes were made in order to output test vectors and lookup tables and adjust truncation. This required editing L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/Settings.h as follows:

### Generation of LUTs and MemPrint files for the reduced combined module chain

The steps needed to generate the configurations files for the reduced combined module chains are explained below.

Step 1: Produce the reduced configuration

Copy over the wires.dat, memorymodules.dat, and processingmodules.dat from the full configuration for the reduced modules to the area where you are running the makeReducedConfig.py. I will assume that the names of these files are cm_wires.dat, cm_processingmodules.dat, and cm_memorymodules.dat.

We have three different reduced combined module configurations:

1) The "CM_Reduced" configuration which is a skinny chain with on TP. To generate the configuation files for this configuration run the command:

```bash
./makeReducedConfig.py -w cm_wires.dat -p cm_processingmodules.dat -m cm_memorymodules.dat -s C -o CM_Reduced_ -t TP --no-graph
```

2) The "CM_Reduced2" configuration which implementes all TP in L1L2 and all barrel MP is L3-L6. To generate this configuration run the command:

```bash
./makeReducedConfig.py -w cm_wires.dat -p cm_processingmodules.dat -m cm_memorymodules.dat -s All -o CM_Reduced2_ -t TP --no-graph
```

3) The "CM_Barrel" configuration which has all barrel TP and MP. To generate the configuation files for this configuration run the commands (removes all disk-related modules):

```bash
cat cm_memorymodules.dat | grep -v "D[1234]" > CM_Barrel_memorymodules.dat
cat cm_processingmodules.dat | grep -v "D[1234]" > CM_Barrel_processingmodules.dat
cat cm_wires.dat | grep -v "D[1234]" > CM_Barrel_wires.dat
```

This should produce the three files

 - CM_{Reduced,Reduced2,Barrel}_wires.dat
 - CM_{Reduced,Reduced2,Barrel}_memorymodules.dat
 - CM_{Reduced,Reduced2,Barrel}_processingmodules.dat

respectively for the different configurations.

Step 2: Run CMSSW to pruduce the test vectors

NOTE - This has been tested in CMSSW_12_6_0_pre5 with the code in the PR #220

Copy the three \*.dat files produced in Step 1 for the relevant configuration above to the 'data' directory where you run CMSSW (TrackletTrackFinding/data)

Assuming interface/Settings.h has already been modified as for the full configuration above, modify python/l1tTTTracksFromTrackletEmulation_cfi.py as follows:

## Continuous Integration (CI) 

Purpose: Automatically run SW quality checks and build the HLS projects (csim, csynth, cosim, and export) for a PR to the master.

In order to keep the GitHub repository public we use GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD:

* GitHub Actions uses a public runner, the workflow is defined in .github/workflows/github_CI.yml
* GitHub Actions mirrors the repository to GitLab and runs GitLab CI/CD
* GitLab CI/CD uses a private runner (lnxfarm327.colorado.edu) and performs the SW quality checks and the HLS builds as defined in .gitlab-ci.yml
    - SW quality checks are based on clang-tidy (llvm-toolset-7.0) and are defined in .clang-tidy and .clang-format very similar to CMSSW
    - HLS builds are using Vivado HLS (or Vitis HLS) and are defined in the script files of the project folder
    - Results (logs and artifacts) of the SW quality checks and HLS builds can be found here https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/firmware-hls/pipelines
    - The default behavior blocks a stage (e.g. Hls-build) when a previous stage (e.g. Quality-check) failed 
* GitHub Actions pulls the GitLab CI/CD status and the pass/fail outcome

### Use CI for Personal Branch

* Add your branch name to the "on:" section of .github/workflows/GitLab_CI.yml 
    - In the "push:" subsection to trigger CI on each push, e.g. "branches: [feat_CI,<your_branch_name>]" and/or
    - in the "pull_request:" subsection to trigger CI on each PR, e.g. "branches: [master,<your_branch_name>]"

## EMP

Build the tracklet chain in EMP.

Currently the supported chain configurations for EMP builds are:

* **Skinny Chain (combined, unsplit modules)**
  * InputRouter to KalmanFilter
    * Target = Apollo VU13P (1 FPGA)
    * EMP build path = `IntegrationTests/ReducedCombinedConfig/IRtoKF`

* **Barrel Chain (combined, unsplit modules)**
  * InputRouter to KalmanFilter
    * Target = Apollo VU13P (1 FPGA)
    * EMP build path = `IntegrationTests/CombinedBarrelConfig/IRtoKF`
    
* **Some info**

    * The EMP firmware uses a subset of the [SURF library](https://github.com/slaclab/surf).
    More info on that in `IntegrationTests/common/hdl/surf_subset/README.md` (Note: this may be unused for the IRtoKF chain)
    * `firmware-hls/KalmanFilter` is a git sub-module link to the repo containing the [Kalman Filter firmware repo](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/l1tk-for-emp/tree/d0d3ba506bf77926862f0d7f3ebf781c041da6eb). Note that different KalmanFilter configurations are needed for the reduced chain, the barrel chain, and the full chain. The Makefile updates this repository to point to the appropriate branch, but if possible, it could be useful for the KalmanFilter repository to support different configurations.
    * Some python and TCL scripts are needed to implement and simulate the EMP firmware.
    More info on that in [this README](https://github.com/cms-L1TK/firmware-hls/blob/doc_emp/IntegrationTests/ReducedConfig/IRtoKF/firmware/scripts/README.md).

* **Note** See [here](https://apollo-lhc.gitlab.io/cornell-cm/Manual/TFFirmware/02-EMPTF/) for more detailed instructions, particularly with regards to installing the prerequisites noted below and for performing tests on Apollo hardware.

```

Source Xilinx Vivado 2021.2 for the following steps

### Vivado/Questa Simulation

**Step 2: Create an ipbb project area**

* For questa simulation testbench:
```
ipbb proj create sim qsim firmware-hls:<EMP build path> 'qsim.dep'
cd proj/qsim
```

* For vivado simulation testbench:
```
ipbb proj create vivado vsim firmware-hls:<EMP build path> 'vsim.dep'
cd proj/vsim
```

**Step 3: Simulation**

* For questa simulation testbench:

```
ipbb sim setup-simlib
ipbb sim ipcores
ipbb sim fli-udp
ipbb sim generate-project #(rerun this if you change VHDL)

./run_sim -c xil_defaultlib.top -Gsourcefile=<input.txt> -Gsinkfile=<out.txt> -Gplaylen=xyz -Gcaplen=xyz -do 'run 50.0us' -do quit 
```
where `xyz = number of events * 108`, where default is 9 events.

where `input.txt` follows the standard EMP pattern file convention. An input file is provided in `../../src/firmware-hls/<EMP build path>/firmware/mem/in.txt`

* For vivado simulation testbench
```
ipbb vivado generate-project
cd vsim
vivado vsim.xpr
```

and start the simulation from GUI (first time will take long).

### Implementation

**Step 2: Create an ipbb project area**

```
ipbb proj create vivado apollo firmware-hls:<EMP build path> 'apollo.dep'
cd proj/apollo
```

**Step 3: Compile**

*Note: Note: For the following commands, you need to ensure that can find & use the `gen_ipbus_addr_decode` script - e.g. for a standard uHAL installation:*
```
export PATH=/opt/cactus/bin/uhal/tools:$PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cactus/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

```
ipbb ipbus gendecoders
ipbb vivado generate-project synth -j8 impl -j8 package
```
